  Each handle site has a version/serial number assigned
  to it.  This is so that a client can tell if a particular
  site's configuration has changed since the last time it
  accessed a server in the site.  Every time you modify a site
  (by changing an IP address, port, or adding a server, etc), 
  you should increment the version/serial number for that site.

  Enter the version/serial number of this site [1]: 

  Please enter a short description of this server/site: foo

  Please enter the name of your organization: foo

  Please enter the name of a contact person
  for foo (optional) [(none)]: bar

  Please enter the telephone number of bar or of foo (optional) [(none)]: 555 DONT-CALL

  Telephone number contains illegal character 'D', please try again.


  Please enter the telephone number of bar or of foo (optional) [(none)]: 555 555-5555

  The handle server can communicate via UDP and/or TCP sockets.

  want to disable UDP services if you are behind such a firewall.

    Do you need to disable UDP services?(y/n) [n]: 

    Server keys already exist, do you want to create new ones? (y/n) [n]:

    You have finished configuring your (primary) Handle service.

    This service now needs to be registered with your prefix 
    administrator.  Organizations credentialed by DONA to 
    register prefixes are listed at the dona.net website. 

    If your prefix administrator is CNRI, go to 
    http://hdl.handle.net/20.1000/111 to register to 
    become a resolution service provider and then upload 
    your newly created sitebndl.zip file. Please read the 
    instructions on this page carefully. When the handle 
    administrator receives your file, a prefix will be 
    created and you will receive notification via email.

    Please send all questions to your prefix administrator, 
    if CNRI at hdladmin@cnri.reston.va.us.
